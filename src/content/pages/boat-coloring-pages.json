    "challenge": "Celebrate the wonders of marine life by coloring your boat scene in shades inspired by beautiful underwater creatures and coral environments. You could render sleek sailboats in iridescent colors reminiscent of tropical fish. Or use muted greens and tans to depict a wooden fishing vessel at home among algae-covered reefs. This naturalistic approach connects your artwork to the vibrant ocean world."
