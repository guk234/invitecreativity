Highlighting and Shadows: On a golf ball, use a pure white base. Add gray shading on the underside and yellow highlights on the top to depict spherical form."

    "colors": "Greens for the course grass. Tans for sand traps. Blues for water hazards. Whites for golf balls. Reds, blues and yellows for golf clothing. But why simply tee off with traditional tones when you can drive your creativity to transcendent new heights? Make your links lavishly lush by incorporating radiant rainbow fairways, shimmering celestial sky effects, or even psychedelic hypnotic putting line trails!",
    "challenge": "Prepare for an unforgettable round by dreaming up an outrageous “Golf Gallimaufry” – an eclectic mishmash of weird and wacky course elements blended seamlessly into one super hole! For example, combine standard fairways and bunkers with off-the-wall hazards like chocolate lava pits, burger bun mounds, or even black holes warping the entire green’s gravity. This boundless creative exercise drives innovative problem-solving."
