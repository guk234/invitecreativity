  "tips": {
    "colors": "Browns from tan to deep espresso. Whites for creams and milks. Greens for leafy accents. Reds and golds for extra warmth. But who says your coffee art has to be cinnamon-sweet? Wake up those cups of joe with zesty citrus hues, decadent chocolate swirls, or mug-hugging characters in vibrant shades!",
    "techniques": "A. Textured Effects: For a foamy latte, use an off-white base color. Layer tan and brown strokes in swirling motions to depict the frothy texture. B. Highlighting and Shadows: On a glossy mug, use a burgundy base coat. Add brighter red highlights on raised areas and shade crevices with deeper browns.",
    "challenge": "Personify your coffee creations by giving mugs, beans, or steam swirls expressive faces and quirky personalities through colorful details and accessories! For example, depict a mug with a grinning face, blushing cheeks made of cinnamon sprinkles, and a tiny sweater keeping it toasty. This imaginative approach helps build storytelling skills while designing cheerful scenes."
