  "tips": {
    "colors": "Blacks, grays and deep purples for the house itself. Oranges for glowing jack-o-lanterns. Greens for twisted trees and overgrown scenery. Don’t just haunt the neighborhood with boring hues! Make your haunted house truly spook-tacular by coloring ghostly figures with eerie blue glows or splattering fluorescent slime drippings.",
    "techniques": "A. Highlighting and Shadows: Use a black base for the haunted house. Add stark white highlights on windows to make them look like peering ghostly faces. B. Color Combinations: For deteriorating wood elements like doors or shutters, use a brown base color. Add deeper shades of red and orange for rusting and decay.",
    "challenge": "Conjure up some monstrous fun by creating a haunted house scene inspired by your favorite horror movies, folklore or imagined otherworldly tales. For example, use deep crimsons and pops of sickly green to capture the mood of a classic vampire’s lair. Or opt for fiery oranges and inky blacks to depict a hellish underworld dwelling. This allows you to tap into your spooky creativity while practicing bold, atmospheric color schemes."
