      "text": "Whites and tans for rice. Pinks and oranges for fish like tuna and salmon. Greens for nori seaweed wraps and avocado. Blacks for soy sauce accents. But why let your sushi scene swim in mundane monotones when you can make it a real catch? Bait those rolls with brilliant neon pops, shimmering pearlescent shines, or an ocean-inspired rainbow gradient!"

      "text": "A. Color Combinations: For a California roll, use green for the nori exterior. Layer yellow for the rice base and add touches of orange for the crab meat filling. B. Highlighting and Shadows: On a piece of nigiri sushi, use a pink base coat for the tuna topping. Add white highlights on raised areas for a glossy shine. Shade underneath with red undertones."
