  "tips": {
    "colors": "Reds, blues, greens for skateboards and gear. Grays for ramps and concrete surfaces. Browns for wooden ramps. Tans for skin tones. But why simply kickflip through predictable palettes when you can truly grind out eye-popping street art masterpieces? Make your skateboarding scene pop by incorporating vivid graffiti splashes, blazing neon vapor trails, or even radiant holographic board graphics!",
    "techniques": "A. Illustrating Specific Elements: For skateboards, use a red base. Add curved line stripes in white and black to depict the wood grain texture. B. Highlighting and Shadows: On a skater doing a trick, use a tan skin tone base. Add red shading under areas of muscle stress. Use white highlights on protruding body parts.",
    "challenge": "Put your skateboarding skills to the ultimate test by reimagining your favorite park as an insanely dangerous “Adrenaline Obstacle Course” pushed to mind-bending extremes! For example, design wildly oversized jump gaps, psychedelic grinding rail sequences that twist into optical illusions, or even physics-defying anti-gravity zones that send skaters soaring. This outrageously high-octane creative exercise amps up adrenaline and thinking-outside-the-box ingenuity!"
