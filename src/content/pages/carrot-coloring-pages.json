  "tips": {
    "colors": "You’ll definitely want to put that iconic orange front and center for classic carrot coloring. A vibrant, bright orange makes the perfect base to capture that fresh carrot vibe. Mix in some rich yellows, warm reds, and even pops of green for the feathery tops to really make those carrots pop off the page.",
    "techniques": "A. Shading: Use a deep, almost brown shade of orange for those shaded areas and ridges to give your carrots amazing dimension. Then lighten up the orange towards the highlights for an ultra-realistic, 3D effect that’ll make them look freshly pulled from the garden. B. Stippling: This dotting technique lets you nail that grooved, textured carrot skin. Use a sharp pencil to stipple tiny dots in varying orange shades all over. Vary your pressure for lighter and darker spots of shading too.",
    "challenge": "Kid artists can surround their bright orange carrots with rich, tilled soil, vibrant green tops poking through, and maybe some furry bunny friends hanging out in the patch. This cheerful carrot is ready to bring some orange sunshine to your coloring pages. And there, in the distance, Corn waves its tall, green husks, inviting Carrot to join in on a veggie-tastic journey filled with laughter and fun!"
