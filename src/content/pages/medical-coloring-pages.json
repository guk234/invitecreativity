  "tips": {
    "colors": "Whites for doctor coats and hospital scenes. Reds for crosses and emergency imagery. Blues, greens, and purples for scrubs and accents. Don’t feel limited to clinical hues, young artists! A colorful bandage here, a patterned X-ray vest there – make your medical world uniquely vibrant.",
    "techniques": "A. Highlighting and Shadows: On a stethoscope, use silver for the base. Add white highlights on the raised areas and shading with grays underneath. B. Illustrating Specific Elements: For a doctor’s jacket, use stark white. Create subtle folds and wrinkles by shading with a light gray.",
    "challenge": "For muscle groups, try layering reds over tans to show definition. Use various greens to depict the vascular system. Or render the skeletal structure in ghostly white over haunting black backgrounds. This allows you to practice advanced techniques while learning about anatomical complexities."
