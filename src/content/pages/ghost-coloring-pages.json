Textured Effects: Use the side of a pencil or crayon. Create a grainy, static-like texture over the ghost. This looks like the ghost is transparent and flickering."

    "challenge": "Color a haunted house scene with ghosts! Use complementary colors that sit opposite on the color wheel, like purple and yellow. This contrasting color scheme makes the ghosts eye-catching against backgrounds. It boosts creativity by coordinating vivid color combinations."
