  "tips": {
    "colors": "Whites for snow. Light blues for backgrounds. Browns for wooden bases. Reds, greens and yellows for decorations. But why not make it extra fun by adding some sparkles or fun patterns? Get creative and make it special!",
    "techniques": "A. Textured Effects: For falling snow, use a white base. Add curved blue lines in different shades to show depth and layers of snowflakes. B. Highlighting and Shadows: For the glass dome, use a pale blue tint. Add white dots on the curved areas to show light reflecting. Shade the underside with navy blue.",
    "challenge": "For an exciting challenge, imagine the snowglobe contains a tiny magical winter world! You could make a little forest with crystal trees and snow animals. Or an arctic town with colorful houses and sleighs. Use your imagination to create a miniature wonderland inside the snowglobe! It’s a fun way to make your coloring page unique."
