  "tips": {
    "colors": "Greens, grays and blues for rotting flesh tones. Browns for dried blood and decay. Blacks for shadows and haunting accents. But feel free to defy dreary undead norms! Breathe new life into your zombie designs with vivid neons, ethereal ghostly auras or even science fiction energy patterns.",
    "techniques": "A. Blending Techniques: Use a green base coat for the zombie’s skin. Blend in grays and blues in random splotches and streaks to show decaying, mottled flesh. B. Highlighting and Shadows: For torn clothing and exposed viscera, use a brown base color. Add deep black shading in crevices and white highlights on raised edges.",
    "challenge": "For an futuristic frightening spin, unleash your imagination by envisioning “Cosmic Zombitrons” – the reanimated robotic undead of a desolate cyberpunk world! You could depict them as withered android husks with sparking circuitry and bioluminescent fluid leaks. Or illustrate half-human cyborg hybrids with necrotic biomechanical grafts. It cleverly fuses horror conventions with a techno twist."
