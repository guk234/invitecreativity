  "tips": {
    "colors": "Pinks, blues, yellows and greens for cupcake bases. White for frostings. Browns for chocolate varieties. Vibrant colors like purples and oranges for decorative sprinkles and accents. Don’t resign your cupcake canvas to a bland, vanilla vision! Make those sweet centerpieces burst with sugary splendor by swirling in kaleidoscopic color blends or adding shimmering pearl dust accents.",
    "techniques": "A. Illustrating Specific Elements: For sprinkles or candy toppings, use bright primary colors like red, yellow and blue. Add white highlights to depict a sugary shine. B. Highlighting and Shadows: On a frosted cupcake, use an off-white base coat. Add yellow highlights on raised swirl areas and shade underneath with gray undertones.",
    "challenge": "Bring your cupcake characters to life by giving them adorable animal personas with colorful, creative details like candy eyes, pretzel antennae or strawberry noses! For instance, create a puppy cupcake with a swirl frosting snout, candy confections for paws, and licorice accents for a leash. This whimsical theme encourages imaginary world-building while practicing fine illustrative skills."
