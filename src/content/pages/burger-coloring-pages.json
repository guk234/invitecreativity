    "colors": "Browns for beef patties. Yellows, reds, and greens for cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce. Tans for buns. Add pops of color like purple for unique toppings. Don’t settle for a bland burger palette! Make your mouthwatering masterpieces sizzle with unexpected accents like neon pickle chips or sriracha squiggles.",
    "techniques": "A. Layering Colors: For a beef patty, use a brown base coat. Layer darker reds into the center, fading outwards for a realistic “cooked” appearance. B. Highlighting and Shadows: On a yellow cheese slice, use a golden base. Add white highlights on raised areas and shade underneath with orange undertones.",
    "challenge": "Design your own wildly creative burger creation by “building” it with an assortment of unexpected colors, toppings and decorative garnishes!"
